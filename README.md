# Project-5
Predictive Analytics and Recommendation Systems in Banking

Problem Statement:
Banks deal with large volumes of customer data and transactions daily. There is a
need to leverage this data to enhance customer experience, reduce risk, and
optimize product offerings. This project aims to solve three critical problems:
1. Predicting loan defaults (Supervised Learning).
2. Segmenting customers based on transaction behavior (Unsupervised
Learning).
3. Recommending suitable banking products to customers (Recommendation
Engine).


Business Use Cases:
● Loan Default Prediction: Banks need to minimize financial risk by predicting
which customers are likely to default on loans. Accurate predictions can lead
to better loan approval processes and risk management.
● Customer Segmentation: By understanding customer behavior, banks can
target their marketing strategies more effectively, enhancing customer
satisfaction and increasing revenue.
● Product Recommendations: Recommending the right products to
customers based on their past behavior can increase customer loyalty and
boost cross-selling opportunities.
